# Iris_classification

We load the Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width) and three target classes (Setosa, Versicolour, Virginica).

We split the dataset into a training set and a testing set (80% for training and 20% for testing).

We create a Logistic Regression model and train it using the training data.

We make predictions on the test data and calculate the accuracy of the model.

We also use the trained model to predict the species of different samples.
